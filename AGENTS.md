# owl-coordinator — agent notes

This repository is the browser coordinator: the framework-independent half of the loading layer — release registry, prepare-vs-activate split, byte and concurrency budgets, request de-duplication, cancellation, intent policy and telemetry.

- `prepare()` must never execute application code: no script insertion, no dynamic import of an entrypoint, no auth, no writes. `test/no-execution.test.mjs` asserts this against every adapter registered in the fleet.
- Every effect (fetch, document, WebAssembly, idle scheduling) is injected through an environment object, so the whole coordinator is testable without a browser and cannot reach an ambient global by accident.
- State is per-document. A normal navigation does not carry a running app to the next page; only a persistent shell does. Do not document or imply otherwise.
- Never React/JSX and never a webview. TypeScript, Rust and Dart are modularized (nothing
  lives only in `main.*`); favor pure functions, explicit inputs and outputs, immutability,
  typed errors, exhaustive matching, and effects pushed to the edges.
- No third-party runtime dependencies in this org. The loading layer is the first thing a
  page runs; it must not drag a dependency tree in front of itself.
- Contracts are TypeSpec + JSON Schema peers checked by ORESoftware/ores-contracts; the
  shared vocabulary comes from `ores-wasm-loaders/owl-interfaces` through zed-pkg.
- Preparation and activation are different operations and must stay that way: preparation
  never executes application code, authenticates, subscribes, or writes.
- Resolve git conflicts semantically (reconcile both sides; never just pick one); never
  rebase, stash, or reset. `main` is production, `dev` is integration.

## Canonical agent instructions

Before doing anything else in this repository, also read:

    .ores/agents/AGENTS.md

That path is a symlink to `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md`, whose canonical copy is
<https://github.com/ORESoftware/my-ai/blob/main/AGENTS.md>. The symlink is deliberately not
committed (it names an absolute path only valid on a machine with that checkout), so `.ores/`
is git-ignored. If it is missing on your machine:

    mkdir -p .ores/agents
    ln -sfn "$HOME/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md" .ores/agents/AGENTS.md

A missing `.ores/agents/AGENTS.md` is a setup gap on the reader's machine, never a reason to
skip the canonical instructions: fetch them from the URL above instead.
